                <h2>Search</h2>
                <p>
                    The regular search is for finding organization units by <i>displaynames</i>. <br/>
                    To search for <i>ID</i>, <i>code</i>, or <i>all three</i>, use the advanced search by pressing the <b>advanced</b> button below the search bar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clicking on one of the results will expand it and show more information
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <b>Locate</b> button will move the map to the unit's location. (Disabled if coordinates are unavailable)</li>
                    <li>The <b>Edit</b> button will allow you to edit the chosen unit's data.</li>
                    <li>The <b>Delete</b> will permanently delete a unit! Use caution. (Only for facilities)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Editing</h2>
                <p>
                    When editing organizational units, the fields <i>Name</i>, <i>Short name</i> and <i>Opening date</i> are
                    mandatory. The date should be on ISO 8601 format.
                    For example: 2016-11-29, or 2016-11-29T09:41:57 if the time is to be included.
                    Click on the map to select a position.
                </p>
                <h2>Browse</h2>
                <p>
                    The Browse page is for navigating the organisation hierarchy.
                    Here you can also edit, delete and create new organizational units.
                </p>
                <h2>New root unit</h2>
                <p>
                    Here you can create a new top-level unit, if you are starting out with an empty database. Dhis2 works best with a single top-level unit.
                </p>
